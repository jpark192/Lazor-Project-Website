# Lazor Project by Jason, Kyu, QiMing

## Project : Lazor 



### Abstract

The goal of this project is to develop a solver for "Lazor" game, that will solve the puzzle with a given initial condition in a relatively short time. 

### Description

For a given initial condition include
 - Grid
 - Blocks (types, numbers)
 - Lazers (start point, direction)
 - Points (where the lazers to intersect)
 
The solver is to do the following
  1. Read in the given initial conditions and set variables
  1. Place Lazers, Points in the Grid
  1. Place given Blocks in Grid 1 by 1 in different positions.
  1. The Solver Code will utilize Trial & Error and Process of Elimination
